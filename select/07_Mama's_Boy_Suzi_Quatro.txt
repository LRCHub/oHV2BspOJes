By the way he looks across his shoulder
And the way he sees things through his eyes
It's impossible to disguise
He's a Mama's Boy

So confusing to my sense of humour
Is the way he hurts so easily
Anyone can see he's a Mama's Boy

Firstly he holds me too softly
Then he touches me barely
Mama's Boy
Then he loves me too quickly
Always everything but manly
Mama's BoyMama's Boy

It's a funny kind of situation
Can't relate to what is happpening
I'm tired of making time with a Mama's Boy
It's an insult to my sense of living
When it seems I'm doin' all the giving
I can't waste one more night
He's a Mama's Boy

Firstly he holds me too softly
Then he touches me barely
Mama's Boy
Then he loves me too quickly
Always everything but manly

Well she tied him to her apron strings
Now he needs her advice on everything
Oh anyone can see he's a Mama's Boy
Don't know why he gets involved with women
He's a closet case with all the trimmings
He's such a pretty thing
He's a Mama's Boy
