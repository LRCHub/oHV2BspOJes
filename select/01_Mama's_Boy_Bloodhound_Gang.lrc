[00:06.92] {Hello Frank, hello mother dear
[00:10.53] Hi, Jim, what are you doin'?
[00:12.78] I am trying to think of words that rhyme with vagina
[00:15.47] Oh, lima? Like lima beans
[00:21.25] How about that, that teenage witch, Sabina
[00:24.29] No, that's a made up word, Jim
[00:26.43] Why don't you change the word vagina to something else
[00:31.07] Like box or pussy or cunt, no Jim}
