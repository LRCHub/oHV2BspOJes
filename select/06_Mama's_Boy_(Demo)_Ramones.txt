Could't keep a secret got a concrete skull
Couldn't shut up you're an imbecile
You're an ugly dog there's nothing to gain
You couldn't shut up got a bad bad brain
Couldn't hold your tongue You were just
Too young like a two year old you told
You told You are all the same jelly

Bean brain Every one's a secret nerd.
Every one's closet lame
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mama's boy
Don't want to work in a hot dog stand
Be a busboy messenger or a doorman
It's an abstract world you're an
Abstract man Abstract city don't give a damn
